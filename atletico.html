            <h1>Giroud Incredible Flick againt Atletico</h1>
            <h2>Olivier Giroud goal: Chelsea striker scores amazing bicycle kick in Champions League vs. Atletico Madrid</h2>
            <p>The original call was that Giroud was offsides, but VAR overturned that ruling and declared it a goal after it was found that the ball hit Mario Hermoso of Atletico Madrid and not Chelsea's Mason Mount. <br>
                The ball being touched by Hermoso before the goal meant Giroud wasn't offside and played in by a teammate.</p>
