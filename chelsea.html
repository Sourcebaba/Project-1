        <h3>How Chelsea got to the final</h3>
         <p>In truth, Chelsea could have scored more. Striker Timo Werner missed two glorious opportunities in the opening stages and Christian Pulisic shot wide in the second half.
            <br>Despite missing his chance, Pulisic made history. When he was subbed on for Werner in the second half,</br>b he became the first American male to play in a Champions League final and became the first American on a Champions League winner as well.</p>
