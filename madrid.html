            <h2 style="text-align: left;"> How Pulisic destroyed Madrid</h2>
            <p>Pulisic was in no mood to waste an opening however, and his decisive strike put the Blues 1-0 up in the 14th minute. <br>Antonio Rudigerâ€™s sumptuous lofted ball caught Real out at the back, allowing Pulisic to spring whatever offside trap there was and power into the box. 
                    The USA forward stayed calm as Courtois raced out, <br>stepping round the keeper before powering home.Pulisic became the first man to score past former Chelsea stopper Thibaut Courtois in six hours and 44 minutes, as the Blues enjoyed a stellar opening.</p>
