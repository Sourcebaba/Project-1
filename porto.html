    <h3>The Coffin from Hong Kong by <i>James Hardly Chase</i></h3>

        <p> A mysterious voice from the telephone; a beautiful Chinese girl shot dead; rich old man with a troubled conscience; a private investigator involved in murder; <br>a Chinese prostitute who talked too much; and a coffin. <br>These are some of the intriguing ingredients of James Hadley Chase's splendid thriller.
             It is definitely a book to keep you awake long after your bedtime.</p>I was just about to shut down the office for the night when the telephone bell rang. <br>The time was ten minutes past six o'clock. It had been a dull, long and unprofitable day: no visitors, a mail I had dropped into the trash basket without even slitting an envelope, and now this first telephone call.
